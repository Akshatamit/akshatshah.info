      <strong> For this Assignment, I and Akshat Shah Worked together. We have created a website through which different Samsung electronics can be sold.
      Initially, We created a navigation bar that allows the user to move through different pages within the webpage. 
      The home page displays different 2019 Samsung products along with clickable images. It allows the user to watch a quick video of that particular product. 
      Moreover, one of the images, when clicked, allows the user to sign up for the upcoming 5g phone. The bottom link displays the features of the phones when clicked.
      In addition, Buy page navigates to the purchasing and adding items to the cart. While the Phone page allows the user to check the price of the new Samsung phone with different storage capacity. It also displays a quick phone introduction video.
      In the about section, the dropdown button displays three other pages; schedule, contact, and summary. Schedule page allows the user to register for upcoming events. The contacts page contains information about the store as well as it allows the user to sign up for email updates regarding Samsung products. Lastly, the summary section describes the individual work on this project.

        <p>All photos are taken from the Samsung's official website and videos are downloaded from the Samsung's official youtube channel and Marques Brownlee's official youtube channel for the Samsung s10 plus review video. We used W3schools.com for some of jquery code assistance as well as StackOverflow.  </p>
